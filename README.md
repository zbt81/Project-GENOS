#  Project GENOS: ASL Robotic Hand

A low-cost, servo-driven robotic hand designed to replicate American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using a Raspberry Pi Pico. This project focuses on accessibility, affordability, and education ‚Äî offering an open-source alternative to high-cost systems like the Neuromaker Hand.

---

##  Project Overview

Project GENOS uses five servo motors to manipulate each finger independently, forming ASL letters such as `C`, `Y`, and `L`. An OLED screen is used to visually display which letter the hand is performing in real-time. Smooth motion transitions are implemented in software to protect the servos and make the movement realistic and safe.

##  Impact

Originally envisioned as a prosthetic for users with limb differences, GENOS evolved to focus on accessibility in the ASL community ‚Äî especially in education and demonstration contexts. By lowering the hardware and software barrier, GENOS opens up possibilities for students, developers, and educators who cannot afford commercial options like the ~$300 Neuromaker.

##  Features

-  Five servo-controlled fingers (thumb to pinky)
-  0.96" OLED screen displays current letter
-  Smooth transition logic avoids sudden servo jerks
-  Degrees-based finger tuning for custom Range of Motion (ROM)
-  Fully programmable via MicroPython
-  Cycles through preset ASL letters with precise movements
